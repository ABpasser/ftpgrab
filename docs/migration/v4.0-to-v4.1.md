# FTPGrab v4.0 to v4.1

Since the project has been renamed `ftpgrab`, some changes have to be made.

```shell
# Rename files and folders
$ mv /opt/ftp-sync/ /opt/ftpgrab
$ mv /var/log/ftp-sync/ /var/log/ftpgrab
$ mv /var/run/ftp-sync/ /var/run/ftpgrab
$ mv /opt/ftpgrab/ftp-sync.conf /opt/ftpgrab/ftpgrab.conf
$ mv /etc/init.d/ftp-sync /etc/init.d/ftpgrab

# Download the latest script and dist config
$ wget https://raw.github.com/ftpgrab/ftpgrab/master/ftpgrab.sh -O /etc/init.d/ftpgrab --no-check-certificate
$ chmod +x /etc/init.d/ftpgrab
$ wget https://raw.github.com/ftpgrab/ftpgrab/master/ftpgrab.conf -O /opt/ftpgrab/ftpgrab.conf --no-check-certificate
```

If you have a cron, do not forget to change the script's name :

```text
0 4 * * * cd /etc/init.d/ && ./ftpgrab seedbox.conf >/dev/null 2>&1
```
