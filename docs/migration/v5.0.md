# FTPGrab v5.0

This release breaks the mechanism of previous releases and is not intended to be upgraded to this one. But you can
easily translate your old configuration file with the new format. Also, the Docker image has been moved to a dedicated
organization on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ftpgrab).
